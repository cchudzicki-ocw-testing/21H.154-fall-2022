### Course Description

This class explores the history, and the mythology, of the famous Japanese warriors, from their origins in classical Japan to their various reincarnations throughout the archipelago's history. We will start in Japan's pre-modern era (200–1600 CE) and follow key historical developments such as the rise of samurai as a recognizable social group, the transformation of Japan into a warrior-governed state, and the ways in which these events reshaped the politics, society, economy, and culture of the entire country. The class will also consider how the samurai identity continued to be reinvented throughout Japan's history and why, even today, they capture the imaginations of many people not only in Japan but around the world.

### Class Goals

1. Gain a deep and nuanced understanding of the significance of “samurai” both as a historical phenomenon and a product of global imagination.
2. Develop the ability to demonstrate such understanding through clear, accurate, and persuasive writing.
3. Share our learning and discoveries as a class through discussions and presentations.
