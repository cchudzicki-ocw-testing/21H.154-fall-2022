## Tokugawa Japan and the Past, Present, and Future of Samurai

Since the late 19th century, many Japanese and non-Japanese observers have come to think of Tokugawa Japan as synonymous with Japan's “pre-modern” past, for better and for worse. 

**In your third and final essay, you are asked to explore one aspect of Tokugawa Japan and analyze it by considering the entire breadth of the histories and ideas we’ve covered in class during the semester.** In other words, you are asked to dig deeper into one key theme or aspect of  Tokugawa Japan (everyday life, politics, culture, religion, etc.) and compare it to the previous periods in Japanese history. If relevant, you may also consider the subsequent evolution of your chosen topic in the modern era (1868~).

Your essay should focus on a single, book-length or similarly substantial primary source. The primary source can either be a larger portion of one of the assigned sources we have discussed in class or may be an entirely new source. The primary task for this paper is to analyze the selected primary source using contextual information provided by in-class lectures, discussions, assigned readings, and at least one additional chapter- or article-length scholarly source. Your primary source and outside secondary source(s) should be chosen in consultation with the instructor.

If you are taking this class as a Japanese-language option subject (21G.554), you are required to incorporate at least one Japanese language primary or secondary source into this essay. The source should be chosen in consultation with the instructor. When you submit your final paper, you are also required to submit a translated abstract (300–500 words) of your source.

## Major Steps

**Step 1:** Conceptualize and decide on the main subject of your research.

It might be helpful to start by looking through the assigned texts in the syllabus. 

Look through the Table of Contents in *Japan Emerging,* and take a quick look at any chapters that sound interesting. \[Preview with [Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Japan_Emerging/iUtWDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)\]

Look through the list of entries in *Samurai: An Encyclopedia of Japan's Cultured Warriors*. \[Preview with [Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Samurai_An_Encyclopedia_of_Japan_s_Cultu/lPaKDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1)\]

Talk to your instructor!

**Step 2:** Decide on the main source that you will analyze.

Here are some historical sources that would make a good primary subject for this assignment:

“Kirishitan monogatari” (The Tale of Christians) in George Elison, *Deus Destroyed*. (Harvard University Press, 1973). This volume also contains other sources, including translations of Japanese sources, on Christianity in 16th and 17th century Japan. 

Donald Keene (trans.), *Chūshingura (The Treasury of Loyal Retainers)*. (Columbia University Press, 1971). The puppet play version of the 47-Ronin incident.

Anne Walthall, trans. and ed., *Peasant Uprisings in Japan*. (University of Chicago Press, 1991). \[Preview with [Google Books](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Peasant_Uprisings_in_Japan/mXiwI_oZfyoC?hl=en&gbpv=1)\] A collection of translated historical sources on the Tokugawa-era peasant rebellions against samurai rule.
